Weiner worked at MIT and was assigned to a project to improve the accuracy of anti-aircraft guns using the noisy radar signals of the day. He published his seminal paper on the subject in 1949. If you have recently used a mobile phone or streamed video or audio you are receiving benefits of wiener's research!\n",

This work was fully developed in their seminal 1970  book. Their theory included the auto regressive moving average (ARMA) model and the auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models we use in this notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "A random series drawn from **independent identically distributed (IID)** noise drawn from a Normal distribution. Such a series is said to be a **white noise** series. Since the series is IID there is no correlation from one value to the next. We can write a **discrete** white noise time series as just:\n",

    "$$X(t) = (w_1, w_2, w_3, \\dots, w_n)\\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "Further, the values of the time series are given at specific or discrete times, making this a discrete time series. In computational time series analysis we nearly always work with discrete time series. Some time series are inherently discrete including, unemployment rate average over a month, the daily closing price of a stock. Even if the underlying time series is continuous, we typically work with **values sampled at discrete points in time**. For example, temperature is a continuous variable, but we will generally work with sampled variables, such as hourly measurements. \n",
